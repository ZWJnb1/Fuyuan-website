## Essential Care Fundamentals

### Watering Wisdom
**The Golden Rule**: Most houseplants die from overwatering, not underwatering.

**How to Check Soil Moisture**:
1. **Finger test**: Insert finger 1-2 inches into soil
2. **Moisture meter**: Use for accurate readings
3. **Weight method**: Lift pot to feel moisture level
4. **Visual cues**: Look for soil pulling away from pot edges

**Watering Techniques**:
- **Water thoroughly** until it drains from bottom holes
- **Use room temperature water** to avoid shocking roots
- **Water in morning** to allow excess to evaporate
- **Empty saucers** after 30 minutes to prevent root rot

**Seasonal Adjustments**:
- **Winter**: Reduce watering frequency by 50%
- **Summer**: Increase watering but maintain good drainage
- **Spring/Fall**: Monitor closely as growth patterns change

### Soil and Potting Essentials
**Choosing the Right Soil**:
- **General houseplants**: Well-draining potting mix
- **Succulents/Cacti**: Sandy, fast-draining mix
- **Orchids**: Bark-based, chunky mix
- **African violets**: Slightly acidic, peat-based mix

**When to Repot**:
- **Roots growing through drainage holes**
- **Water runs straight through without absorbing**
- **Plant becomes top-heavy and tips over**
- **Soil depleted and compacted**
- **Generally every 1-3 years** depending on growth rate

## Fertilizing for Healthy Growth

### Understanding Plant Nutrition
**Primary Nutrients (N-P-K)**:
- **Nitrogen (N)**: Promotes leafy, green growth
- **Phosphorus (P)**: Supports root development and flowering
- **Potassium (K)**: Enhances overall plant health and disease resistance

**Secondary and Micronutrients**:
- **Calcium, Magnesium, Sulfur**: Structural components
- **Iron, Manganese, Zinc**: Essential for various plant functions

### Fertilizing Schedule
**Growing Season (Spring/Summer)**:
- **Liquid fertilizer**: Every 2-4 weeks at half strength
- **Slow-release granules**: Every 3-4 months
- **Organic options**: Compost tea, fish emulsion monthly

**Dormant Season (Fall/Winter)**:
- **Reduce frequency**: Monthly or stop completely
- **Lower concentration**: Quarter strength if fertilizing
- **Watch for signs**: Yellowing may indicate over-fertilization

### Signs of Nutrient Deficiency
- **Nitrogen deficiency**: Yellowing older leaves
- **Phosphorus deficiency**: Purple or reddish leaves
- **Potassium deficiency**: Brown leaf edges
- **Iron deficiency**: Yellow leaves with green veins

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Pest Management
**Common Indoor Plant Pests**:

**Aphids**:
- **Identification**: Small, soft-bodied insects on new growth
