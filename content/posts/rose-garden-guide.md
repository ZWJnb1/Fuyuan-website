## Planting Your Roses

### Best Planting Time

### Site Selection
Choose a location with:
- **6+ hours of morning sunlight**
- **Good air circulation** to prevent disease
- **Well-draining soil** with pH 6.0-7.0
- **Protection from strong winds**

### Planting Steps
1. **Dig a hole** twice as wide as the root ball and as deep
2. **Amend the soil** with compost or well-rotted manure
3. **Position the plant** with the graft union at soil level
4. **Backfill carefully** and water thoroughly
5. **Apply mulch** around the base, keeping it away from the stem

## Essential Rose Care

### Watering
- **Deep, infrequent watering** is best
- **Water at the base** to avoid wetting foliage
- **1-2 inches per week** including rainfall
- **Morning watering** allows leaves to dry quickly

### Fertilizing
- **Early spring**: Apply balanced fertilizer (10-10-10)
- **Mid-season**: Feed with rose-specific fertilizer
- **Late summer**: Stop nitrogen feeding to prepare for winter
- **Organic options**: Compost, fish emulsion, bone meal

### Pruning
**When to Prune**: Late winter/early spring, after last frost

**How to Prune**:
1. Remove dead, diseased, and damaged wood
2. Cut out weak, spindly growth
3. Open the center for air circulation
4. Make cuts at 45-degree angles above outward-facing buds

### Disease Prevention
Common rose diseases and prevention:
- **Black Spot**: Ensure good air circulation, avoid overhead watering
- **Powdery Mildew**: Plant resistant varieties, provide morning sun
- **Rust**: Water at soil level, remove affected leaves promptly

## Seasonal Rose Care Calendar

## Companion Planting

Enhance your rose garden with complementary plants:
